# Hierarchical-Animation

I developed this for my graphics class. Our assignment was to develop a system that could render a hierarchical model of an insect, where each of the six legs has two joints with one degree of freedom each, and the head has two degrees of freedom. We also had to be able to move the camera in multiple different ways.

Instructions for Spencer's stupidly colorful sphere insect:

1. The keys corresponding to the six legs are a, s, d, f, g, and h

2. The key corresponding to the head is j

3. Use the arrow keys while holding any combination of the above keys to move
   the corresponding joints (up and down for each leg joint; up, down, left,
   and right for the head).
   
4. Press + to move the camera closer to the focus.

5. Press - to move the camera farther from the focus.

6. Move the mouse around to rotate the camera about the focus.

7. Drag the mouse to move the focus.

8. ALL HAIL THE STUPIDLY COLORFUL SPHERE INSECT
